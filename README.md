# Randomly generated integrated data
Exploring the creation of an artificial IDI with randomly generated data

#### Goal
For learning and training purposes it would be useful for researchers to have access to a data set with some of the properties of the Integrated Data Infrastructure. There is no need for such a dataset to contain actual data, nor for the randomly generated data to be very close to the truth. Hence I am creating this data source by randomly generating data.

Given my experience working with the IDI, I have some idea of the general patterns that are found in the data (for example, where two tables should contain consistent information). This artificial dataset contains some of the patterns that I think might be relevant for researchers to encounter when practicing.

#### Dataset use
This dataset is artificial, it was randomly generated for the purposes of training and practice. No results generated using this randomly generated data should be used for any purpose beyond teaching, training, or practice. Any results generated from this data are have no meaning.
